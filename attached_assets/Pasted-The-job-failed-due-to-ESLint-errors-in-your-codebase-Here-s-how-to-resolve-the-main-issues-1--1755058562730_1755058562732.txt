The job failed due to ESLint errors in your codebase. Here’s how to resolve the main issues:

1. "Defined but never used" Errors
Remove unused variables or use them if they’re needed. For example:

In client/src/components/tournament-card.tsx at line 11:

Diff
- const tournament = ...
Remove the unused variable if not needed, or use it in your code.

In client/src/components/ui/carousel.tsx at line 17:

Diff
- const carouselApi = ...
In client/src/components/ui/chart.tsx at line 10:

Diff
- const key = ...
Similar issues exist for variables like open, value, _event, _error, tournamentTitle, data, useEffect, next, req, _next, _options, _limit, _window, etc. across various files.

Solution:
For each of these, either:

Remove the variable if not needed.
Prefix with an underscore if required by your linter (e.g., _req) and your linter is configured to allow unused variables when prefixed.
Use the variable in your implementation.
2. TypeScript "Unexpected any" Warnings
Specify proper types instead of using any. For example:

Diff
- function foo(bar: any) {
+ function foo(bar: string) {
Replace any with the actual expected type.

3. "Require statement not part of import statement"
In server/config.ts at line 180, use ES module imports instead of require:

Diff
- const something = require('something')
+ import something from 'something'
4. "Unnecessary escape character" in Regular Expressions
In server/validation.ts (lines 14, 23, 53, 56), remove unnecessary escaping. For example:

Diff
- const regex = /\\[abc\\]/;
+ const regex = /[abc]/;
Validate your regex and remove unneeded backslashes.

5. "Assignment to function parameter"
Do not assign values to function parameters directly. Instead, assign to a new variable:

Diff
- function update(val) { val = process(val); }
+ function update(val) { const newVal = process(val); }
6. "Unexpected control character(s) in regular expression"
In your regex, avoid using control characters like \x00, \x01, \x1f unless absolutely needed and ensure your regex is correct.
